Title

Subtitle
--------
Titles are underlined (or over-
and underlined) with a printing
nonalphanumeric 7-bit ASCII
character. Recommended choices
are "``= - ` : ' " ~ ^ _ * + # < >``".
The underline/overline must be at
least as long as the title text.

A lone top-level (sub)section
is lifted up to be the document's
(sub)title.

Bullet lists:
===============

- This is item 1

- This is item 2

- Bullets are "-", "*" or "+".
  Continuing text must be aligned
  after the bullet and whitespace.

Note that a blank line is required
before the first item and after the
last, but is optional between items.

===================
Enumerated lists:
===================

3. This is the first item
4. This is the second item
5. Enumerators are arabic numbers,
   single letters, or roman numerals
6. List items should be sequentially
   numbered, but need not start at 1
   (although not all formatters will
   honour the first index).
#. This item is auto-enumerated

==================
Definition lists:
==================

what
  Definition lists associate a term with
  a definition.

how
  The term is a one-line phrase, and the
  definition is one or more paragraphs or
  body elements, indented relative to the
  term. Blank lines are not allowed
  between term and definition.

        **Advantages of reStructuredText (RST):**

        1. **Readability:** RST is designed to be easy to read and write, making it accessible for both developers and non-developers.

        2. **Structured Documentation:** RST supports a structured approach to documentation, allowing for easy organization of content into sections, lists, and more.

        3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** RST is widely supported and can be converted to various formats such as HTML, PDF, and more.

        **Disadvantages of reStructuredText (RST):**

        1. **Learning Curve:** While RST is relatively simple, there is still a learning curve, especially for those new to markup languages.

        2. **Limited Styling:** Compared to some other markup languages, RST has limited styling options, which may be a drawback for those who require highly stylized documentation.

        3. **Complex Tables:** Creating complex tables in RST can be challenging, and the syntax might be less intuitive for complex layouts.
